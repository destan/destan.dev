    <h1>Destan Sarpkaya
      <span>
        Software Architect
      </span>
    </h1>

    <main>
      <h2>SOME OF MY SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS</h2>

      <h3>Grispi.com, Grispi Inc.</h3> <a href="https://grispi.com/en/" target="_blank">See Grispi.com live</a>
      <p>
        Designed and implemented (with a team of 7) a support ticket management SaaS application developed with Micronaut and Spring frameworks.
        It has following significant features: Plugin infrastructure and SDK, custom fields, triggers, dynamic filters, VoIP integration, chat, social media integration, custom reporting.
      </p>

      <h3>Motor Own Damage Premium Calculation Modernization in Allianz, Kod Gemisi</h3>
      <p>
        Developed with Spring Boot and Angular, it is a modernization and a complete re-write of Allianz’s motor own damage
        (MOD) product premium calculation, quote generation and policy production process. Almost the whole business logic
        was transformed from Oracle PL/SQL to Spring services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the Java architect and developer team lead for the project and my responsibilities were technical design, tool and
        technology selection, pipeline design, documentation, creating and enforcing coding standards & conventions, team
        management, team training, reporting to upper management and investigating and fixing performance problems,
        adjusting JVM, Weblogic and Coherence parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed a service-oriented solution that provides a separate Spring Boot application for every distinct business
        capability. Designed low level class interaction and interfaces for every application in a way that even in an unsupervised
        development environment code-rot is significantly prevented by the design (class hierarchy, interaction and visibility).
      </p>
      <p>
        Created a custom insurance product framework tailored to Allianz’s use cases on top of Spring Boot which significantly
        decreases amount of boiler plate hence decreases the time to market. The framework also hides most of the business
        complexity from the developer hence bug fix and new feature costs decreased as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created a number of Java libraries to provide business-logic-free, common tasks (cross-cutting-concerns) for the
        applications with comprehensive developer documentation, Javadoc and usage examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was a great success, it consumed drastically less resources (old application needed 24 server instances, new
        application outperforms it only with 3 instances) and perform significantly better (old application created quotes in ~10s
        the new application created in ~800ms).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the MOD project is deployed to production, three more projects started with the same infrastructure and I also
        participated those projects with the same role. Before I left Allianz, upper management decided to transform all non-health products to new infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h3>Analysis and Redesign of Infrastructure Applications of Vodafone Turkey, Quasys</h3>
      <p>
        Analysis of Vodafone’s real-time and near real-time applications’ current architecture, source codes, build scripts and
        creating a new high-level and low-level architectural designs to adapt the applications into microservices world in a cloud
        deployment environment utilizing Kubernetes (OpenShift), Spring Cloud and message queues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Produced reports on problems of the current design and a roadmap with a clear action plan for transition to a cloud ready
        architecture. The reports also provided some technology and tooling comparison with technical, management and
        budget point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reports received compliments from the management and eventually used to decide on which technologies to be
        chosen on the new private cloud infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h3>Suite for SMEs, Kod Gemisi</h3>
      <p>
        Developed with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, it was an application developed with microservices architecture which aims
        to solve HR processes, leave management, invoice tracking, resource planning, project cost tracking and budget reporting
        for any small and medium enterprise (SME).
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed the microservices according to business capabilities and aggregate roots, provide a roadmap for the team with
        implementation plan and guidance. Ensure code quality and best practices with strict code reviews. Created auto-scale
        rules and scripts for Docker.
      </p>
      <p>
        The microservice architecture was robust and elastic enough so after three years we are still able to add new features
        and applications to the suite.
      </p>
